# Ember-cli-amd

The Ember loader is conflicting with the AMD loader. The Ember loader is not async and doesn't comply with the RequireJS or AMD specs. 

This addon will:
* Update the code generated by Ember to avoid conflicts with the AMD loader
* Update the index.html:
  * load any pure AMD modules found in the code first using the AMD loader. 
  * load the Ember code as AMD modules (app and vendor)
  * reference the AMD modules inside the Ember loader

[View it live](http://esri.github.io/ember-cli-amd/) using the [ArcGIS API for JavaScript](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/).

## Compatibility

* Ember.js v2.18 or above
* Ember CLI v2.13 or above

## Breaking changes
The version 2.x has removed some old and unecessary features.

## Features
* Load AMD modules in parallel with [ember-cli/loader.js](https://github.com/ember-cli/loader.js).
* Works with AMD CDN libraries, such as [Dojo](https://dojotoolkit.org/download/) or the [ArcGIS API for JavaScript](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/).

## Usage

`ember install ember-cli-amd`

Update the ember-cli-build file. See configuration below as an example:
```javascript
var app = new EmberApp({
  amd : {
    // Specify the loader path. Can be a CDN path or a relative path in the dist folder
    // - CDN: loader: 'https://js.arcgis.com/3.15/'
    // - Local: loader: 'assets/jsapi/dojo.js'
    loader: 'https://js.arcgis.com/4.11/',
    // User defined AMD packages used in the application
    // import foo from 'esri/foo';
    packages: ['esri','dojo','dojox','dijit','put-selector','xstyle','dgrid'],
    // Optional: The AMD configuration file path relative to the project root.
    // The file will be copied to the output directory (./dist) and the configuration file
    // will be loaded before the loader is loaded. The configuration file must define the global variable used by the specific loader.
    // For dojo, the supported global variable name are `dojoConfig`, `djConfig` or `require`.
    // For requirejs, the global variable is called `require`.
    // Please refer to the documentation for the correct use of the configuration object.
    configPath: 'config/dojo-config.js',
    // Optional: a list of relative paths from the build directory that should not be parsed by ember-cli-amd.
    // This is useful for:
    // - when using an AMD api locally and copied under public folder. The files will be copied under the build folder. These files are pure AMD
    //   modules and should not be converted.
    // - when copying from public to build directory files that are pure JS
    excludePaths: ['assets/jspai', 'assets/myLibThatDontUseEmberDefineOrRequire'],
    // Optional: A boolean flag the indicate whether the injected AMD config file and the AMD Module definition file should be
    // inserted into the HTML using an inline script (e.g. <script>var dojoConfig = { async: true }</script>)
    // or inserted using a src (e.g. <script src="/assets/amd-config.js"></script>)
    // Using inline false is handy when deploying an app with a security content policy that does not allow inline scripts to run
    // Defaults to true
    inline: true | false
  }
});
```

## Example using the CDN resources

```javascript
// ember-cli-build.js
module.exports = function(defaults) {

  var app = new EmberApp(defaults, {
    amd :{
      loader: 'https://js.arcgis.com/3.15/',
      configPath: 'config/dojo-config.js',
      packages: ['esri','dojo','dojox','dijit','put-selector','xstyle','dbind','dgrid'],
      excludePaths: ['assets/workers']
    }
  });

  return app.toTree();
};
```

```javascript
// config/dojo-config.js if using dojo
var dojoConfig = {
  async: true
};
```

# Using a CDN for your application's assets
When using `ember-cli-deploy` it is common to deploy the assets of an ember application to a different location (cdn) from the `index.html`. The [ember-cli-deploy](http://ember-cli.com/ember-cli-deploy/docs/v0.5.x/fingerprinting/) documentation discusess how to use fingerprinting to prepend fully-qualified urls to the asset locations. As of v0.4.1 of `ember-cli-amd` these same options are applied to the AMD related scripts that are injected into the page, thus allowing this to work smoothly with `ember-cli-deploy`.

# Running

* `ember server`
* Visit your app at http://localhost:4200.

### Running tests

* `ember test`
* `ember test --server`

### Running the dummy application

* `ember serve`
* Visit the dummy application at [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200).
