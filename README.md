# ember-cli-amd

The Ember loader is conflicting with the AMD loader. The Ember loader is not async and doesn't comply with the RequireJS or AMD specs. 

This addon will:
* Allow you to import AMD modules from you Ember code. Example: `import Map from 'esri/Map';`
* Update the code generated by Ember to avoid conflicts with the AMD loader
* Update the index.html:
  * load any pure AMD modules found in the code first using the AMD loader. 
  * load the Ember code as AMD modules (app and vendor)
  * reference the AMD modules inside the Ember loader

[View it live](http://esri.github.io/ember-cli-amd/) using the [ArcGIS API for JavaScript](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/).

## Breaking changes
The version 2.x has removed some old and unecessary features.

## Features
* Load AMD modules and register them in Ember loader. [ember-cli/loader.js](https://github.com/ember-cli/loader.js).
* Works with AMD CDN libraries, such as [ArcGIS API for JavaScript](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/).

## Usage

`ember install ember-cli-amd`

Update the ember-cli-build file. See configuration below as an example:
```javascript
var app = new EmberApp({
  amd : {
    // Specify the loader path. Can be a CDN path or a relative path in the dist folder
    // - CDN: loader: 'https://js.arcgis.com/4.14/'
    // - Local: loader: 'assets/jsapi/init.js'
    loader: 'https://js.arcgis.com/4.14/',
    
    // User defined AMD packages used in the application
    packages: ['esri','dojo'],
    
    // Optional: The AMD configuration script file path relative to the project root.
    // The file will be copied to the output directory (./dist) and the configuration script
    // will be executed before the AMD loader is loaded. 
    configPath: 'config/amd-config.js',
    
    // Optional: a list of relative paths from the build directory that should not be parsed by ember-cli-amd.
    // This is useful for:
    // - when using an AMD api locally and copied under public folder. The files will be copied under the build folder. These files are pure AMD
    //   modules and should not be converted.
    // - when copying from public to build directory files that are pure JS
    excludePaths: ['assets/jsapi', 'assets/myLibThatDontUseEmberDefineOrRequire']
  }
});
```

## Example using the CDN resources

```javascript
// ember-cli-build.js
module.exports = function(defaults) {

  var app = new EmberApp(defaults, {
    amd :{
      loader: 'https://js.arcgis.com/4.14/',
      packages: ['esri','dojo'],
      excludePaths: ['assets/workers']
    }
  });

  return app.toTree();
};
```
